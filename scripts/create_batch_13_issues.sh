create_issue_with_retry \
  "Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Readiness Audit & Integration" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,security" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

As quantum computing advances, we need to ensure the Stellar-K8s operator and managed nodes are prepared for PQC.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Research and document the impact of PQC on Stellar Core's signing mechanisms.
- Implement an optional sidecar that can provide PQC-safe signatures for internal operator communication.
- Benchmark the performance overhead of PQC algorithms (e.g., Crystals-Kyber) within the K8s cluster.

  "Stellar Core WASM-based SQL Triggers for Real-time Data Indexing" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,performance" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Ingesting ledger data usually requires heavy polling. We want to use WASM modules inside the operator to react to database triggers from Stellar Core's DB.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Integrate a WASM runtime that can be triggered by database change events (using \`pg_net\` or similar).
- Implement a 'Reactive Reconciler' that updates \`StellarNodeStatus\` immediately when a ledger is closed in the DB.
- Measure the reduction in API polling overhead.

  "Federated Learning for Stellar Network Anomaly Detection" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,observability" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Identify network attacks or performance issues by training a model across multiple Stellar-K8s instances without sharing raw sensitive data.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a 'Learning Sidecar' that collects anonymized network metrics.
- Integrate with a federated learning framework (e.g., PySyft or Flower).
- Train a model to detect 'Eclipse Attacks' or 'Slow Validator' symptoms.

  "Automated 'Green Mining': Carbon-Aware Scheduling for Stellar Nodes" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,performance" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Stellar is energy-efficient, but K8s clusters often run on carbon-heavy grids.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Integrate with ElectricityMap or carbon-intensity APIs.
- The operator should automatically shift non-critical 'Read Pool' replicas to regions with lower carbon intensity.
- Provide a 'Sustainability Dashboard' showing the CO2 footprint of the managed Stellar infra.

# ─── ISSUE 5 (200 pts) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
create_issue_with_retry \
  "Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration for Validator Seeds" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,security" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Validator seeds should never touch K8s Secret storage directly in high-security environments.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement support for AWS CloudHSM or Azure Dedicated HSM.
- The operator should facilitate the handshake between the Stellar Core pod and the HSM.
- Ensure the seed is only injected into memory and never persisted in the K8s etcd.

  "Dynamic Quorum Set Optimization: Auto-balancing Validator Weights" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,reliability" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Quorum sets are usually static. We want the operator to recommend (or apply) quorum set changes based on live network health.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement an algorithm that monitors the 'Uptime' and 'Latency' of all peers in a quorum set.
- Automatically suggest quorum set changes or adjust transition weights to maintain consensus safety.

  "EBPF-based Network Isolation for Stellar Protocols" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,security" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Standard K8s NetworkPolicies are L4. We need L7 deep packet inspection using eBPF to ensure only valid SCP messages are allowed.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement an eBPF program (using \`aya-rs\` or \`libbpf-rs\`) that filter traffic on port 11625.
- Reject any packet that doesn't follow the XDR-encoded Stellar protocol structure.
- Export eBPF-derived metrics to Prometheus.

  "Self-Healing State: Automated DB Vacuum and Reindexing" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,performance" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Horizon databases grow fast and suffer from bloat. The operator should handle maintenance.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a 'Maintenance Window' controller.
- Automatically trigger VACUUM FULL and reindexing of bloated Horizon tables during low-traffic periods.
- Coordinate this with the read-pool to ensure zero-downtime during maintenance.

  "STUN/TURN Integration for NAT Traversal in Managed Nodes" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,performance" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Enable Stellar nodes to run effectively in air-gapped or restricted NAT environments within K8s.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a sidecar that handles STUN/TURN traversal for the Stellar P2P protocol.
- Integrate with ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) for optimal path discovery.

# ─── ISSUE 10 (200 pts) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  "Operator 'God Mode': Comprehensive Forensic Snapshotting" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,reliability" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

When a node fails in a weird way, we need a full forensic dump (memory, disk, network traces).

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a \`debug-snapshot\` feature.
- When triggered, the operator should simultaneously capture a heap dump, a core dump, and a 60-second PCAP of the node's traffic.
- Upload the encrypted bundle to a secure S3 bucket for analysis.
