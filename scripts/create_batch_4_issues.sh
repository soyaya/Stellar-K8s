# 29. Chaos Mesh Integration (High - 200 pts)
gh issue create --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Integrate Chaos Mesh for Network Partition Testing" \
  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

To ensure the operator handles fragile network conditions gracefully, we need to integrate Chaos Mesh. This task involves creating automated chaos scenarios to test node recovery during network partitions.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Create \`tests/chaos/\` directory with Chaos Mesh manifests (NetworkChaos).
- Implement a test script that triggers a partition and verifies the Operator's recovery logic.
- Document the \"Failure Mode and Effects Analysis\" (FMEA) for StellarNode.

gh issue create --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Implement Dynamic Peer Discovery Controller" \
  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Currently, peers are defined statically. We need a controller that dynamically discovers other \`StellarNode\` resources in the cluster and updates the \`KNOWN_PEERS\` configuration in real-time.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a watcher for \`StellarNode\` resources.
- Automatically update a shared \`ConfigMap\` with the latest peer IPs/Ports.
- Trigger a rolling update or signal the Stellar process to refresh configuration.

Large Stellar deployments should span multiple Kubernetes clusters. This task involves updating the operator to support cross-cluster communication and synchronization.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Add \`cluster: String\` field to \`StellarNodeSpec\`.
- Support ExternalName services or service-mesh (Submariner/Istio) for cross-cluster DNS.
- Implement logic to handle node latency thresholds between clusters.

  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

If a node gets stuck or significantly behind the network, it may need an automated restart or a fresh sync. The operator should detect this and perform safe remediation.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Detect \"stale\" state (ledger height not increasing for X minutes).
- Implement automated remediation steps: Restart -> Clear DB -> Fresh Sync.
- Emit Kubernetes Events for every automated action taken.

Storing node keys in plain Kubernetes Secrets is not sufficient for high-security environments. Integrate with cloud-native KMS (AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS) or HSMs.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Support \`keySource: KMS\` in the spec.
- Implement an InitContainer that fetches and decrypts keys from a Vault/KMS.
- Ensure keys never touch the disk in plaintext.

When upgrading Horizon or Soroban RPC, we should support canary deployments where only a percentage of traffic hits the new version.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
