create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar check-sync' diagnostic command in CLI" "stellar-wave,enhancement,dx" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Provide a specialized diagnostic tool that analyzes the sync lag of a specific node compared to its peers directly from the CLI.

### 📋 Context
Operators often need to quickly diagnose if a node is 'stuck' or just 'slow' without digging through raw logs or Grafana dashboards.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Add \`check-sync\` subcommand to the operator or plugin.
- The command should fetch the latest ledger sequence from the node and cross-reference it with public Stellar endpoints.
- Output a clear summary: 'Fully Synced', 'Catching Up (X ledgers behind)', or 'Stalled'.

create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar-operator' Log Scrubbing for Sensitive Data" "stellar-wave,enhancement,security" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Ensure that any potentially sensitive data (e.g., partial private keys, internal hashes) is never accidentally logged by the operator's reconciliation logic.

### 📋 Context
Even with structured logging, deep traces can sometimes capture raw payloads that contain internal state that shouldn't be exposed in log aggregation systems.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a custom \`tracing::Layer\` that identifies and redacts sensitive patterns (e.g., base64 segments that look like seeds).
- Audit all \`info!\`, \`debug!\`, and \`error!\` calls in the reconciler to ensure they only log non-sensitive metadata.

create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'Node Maintenance Mode' in the Reconciler" "stellar-wave,enhancement,reliability" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Add a feature that allows operators to pause reconciliation for a specific node during manual maintenance without triggering alerts or remediation.

### 📋 Context
Sometimes an operator needs to manually poke a database or run a forensic tool. They don't want the controller 'fixing' things while they are working.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Add an \`annotation\` (e.g., \`stellar.org/maintenance: true\`) to the \`StellarNode\`.
- When set, the reconciler should skip all mutation steps but continue reporting health status.
- Add a visible flag to the \`stellar info\` output.
- Log a warning when a node remains in maintenance mode for over 24 hours.

create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar-operator' Self-Upgrade Simulation" "stellar-wave,enhancement,ci" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Add an automated E2E test that verifies the operator can be upgraded to a new version without causing downtime for managed Stellar nodes.

### 📋 Context
Upgrading the control plane shouldn't break the data plane. We need to guarantee that new operator versions handle the state of resources created by older versions.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Create a k6/bash script that performs an 'Old -> New' operator upgrade in a Kind cluster.
- Verify that leader election is handed over smoothly.
- Ensure managed pods are not unnecessarily restarted if their spec remains identical.
- Check that the \`status\` field is updated correctly after the upgrade.

create_issue_with_retry "Add Property-Based Metadata Propagation for K8s Labels" "stellar-wave,enhancement,reliability" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Ensure that all labels applied to a \`StellarNode\` CRD are intelligently propagated to all child resources (Deployments, PVCs, Services).

### 📋 Context
Many organizational workflows depend on specific labels for billing, ownership, or network policy. These must be consistent across the entire resource tree.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a whitelist/blacklist filter for label propagation.
- Automatically inject \`app.kubernetes.io/*\` labels based on the CRD values.
- Ensure that updates to CRD labels are reflected in child resources during the next reconciliation.
- Add unit tests verifying label inheritance.

# ─── 11 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar-operator' Readiness Probe leveraging Core status" "stellar-wave,enhancement,reliability" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Enhance the operator's readiness check to ensure it not only 'can run' but 'has successfully connected' to all required dependencies.

### 📋 Context
A green health check often just means the HTTP server is up. We need a 'deep' health check that verifies connectivity to the K8s API and any internal caches.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Extend the \`/readyz\` endpoint to return 500 if the K8s watch stream is stalled.
- Monitor the latency of internal state updates.
- Export readiness metrics as a gauge.
- Update the Deployment to wait for this probe before allowing secondary leader replicas to shut down.

create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar prune' command for history archives" "stellar-wave,enhancement,performance" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Provide a utility that helps clean up old history archives from S3/Storage without having to manually parse Stellar Core's archive structure.

### 📋 Context
Over time, history archives grow and can become expensive. Automating the pruning of very old checkpoints (that are no longer needed for catch-up) is valuable.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Add \`prune-archive\` subcommand.
- Safely identify checkpoints older than a specified retention threshold.
- Execute the prune operation with 'dry-run' protection.
- Document the safety guarantees to prevent data loss.

create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar diff' command to compare CRD vs Actual K8s" "stellar-wave,enhancement,dx" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Provide a way for operators to see a live 'diff' of what the operator *thinks* should be deployed versus what is *actually* in the cluster.

### 📋 Context
When things go wrong, it's hard to tell if the operator is failing to apply or if it's applied something that the pod runtime is rejecting.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Add \`diff\` subcommand.
- Compare the desired state (calculated from CRD) with live resources (fetched from API).
- Output a colored diff (similar to \`kubectl diff\`).
- Include internal fields like ConfigMaps and resource limits.

### 📚 Resources

# ─── 15 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar-operator' Memory Leak Detection in CI" "stellar-wave,enhancement,ci" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Add a long-running soak test in CI that monitors the operator's memory usage over 1 hour of constant reconciliation to catch potential leaks.

### 📋 Context
Even in Rust, memory can 'leak' if handles are held too long or global states are abused. This is critical for an operator that runs for months.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Add a \`soak-test\` workflow in GitHub Actions.
- Run a script that creates/deletes 100 StellarNodes repeatedly.
- Monitor RSS/Heap size using \`ps\` or \`prometheus\`.
- Fail CI if memory grows beyond a specific threshold (e.g., 5MB growth per hour).

create_issue_with_retry "Implement 'stellar-operator' Crash Loop Analysis sidecar" "stellar-wave,enhancement,dx" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Add a small sidecar to the operator deployment that captures and analyzes crash logs to provide human-readable 'Fix Recommendations'.

### 📋 Context
Stack traces are scary for junior operators. A sidecar that sees 'Connection Refused' and says 'Check your NetworkPolicies' would be high-value.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Create a lightweight diagnostic sidecar (Rust/Bash).
- Capture logs from the main operator container.
- Use pattern matching to identify common issues (RBAC, API timeouts, DB errors).
- Output the 'Fix Recommendation' to the pod description (via events/annotations).

create_issue_with_retry "Add Support for Node Anti-Affinity based on SCP slices" "stellar-wave,enhancement,reliability" "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Implement a mechanism where the operator intelligently spreads validator pods across different hardware nodes based on their quorum set membership.

### 📋 Context
If all validators in a single quorum slice end up on the same physical host, an underlying hardware failure could stall the entire network.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement an 'SCP-Aware' placement logic.
- The operator should inject \`podAntiAffinity\` rules that discourage placing nodes from the same slice on the same \`kubernetes.io/hostname\`.
- Support this configuration via a new \`placement\` block in the CRD.
