  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Standard backups are not enough. This task involves building a controller that manages a 'hot standby' node in a completely different Kubernetes cluster (and region), ensuring minimal RTO/RPO for the Stellar network.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement cross-cluster state synchronization logic.
- Automated failover mechanism using external DNS (Route53/Cloudflare).
- Verify data consistency during regional partition scenarios.

gh issue create --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Integrate MetalLB/BGP Anycast for Global Node Discovery" \
  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

To make Stellar nodes truly resilient, we should announce node IPs via BGP Anycast. This allows the network to route traffic to the nearest healthy node automatically.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Integration with MetalLB or Cilium BGP Control Plane.
- Automated IP allocation and BGP advertisement per StellarNode.
- Support for health-aware route withdrawal.

gh issue create --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Automate High-Availability DBs via CloudNativePG Integration" \
  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Currently, DB management is manual or basic. This task involves integrating the Stellar-K8s operator with the CloudNativePG operator to manage self-healing, HA Postgres clusters for Horizon and Core.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Provision \`Cluster\` resources (CNPG) instead of simple Deployments.
- Automated backup/restore integration with CNPG Barman.
- Connection pooling support (PgBouncer).

gh issue create --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Implement Native Hardware Security Module (HSM) Support" \
  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Validators require the highest level of key security. This task implements native integration for cloud HSMs (AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM) to sign transactions without keys ever leaving the secure module.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Sidecar/InitContainer implementation for PKCS#11 integration.
- Secure key-loading into Stellar Core memory from HSM.
- Automated HSM health monitoring.

  --title "Implement Automated Performance Regression Test Suite" \
  --body "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

As the operator grows, performance can degrade. Implement an automated benchmarking suite that measures TPS, latency, and resource consumption for every new release.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Load-testing framework integration (k6 or Locust).
- Comparative analysis of metrics between release versions.
- Block CI/CD if performance regressions > 10%.

Standard validation is static. Implement a webhook that allows users to provide custom Wasm-based validation logic for their \`StellarNode\` resources (e.g., complex infrastructure constraints).

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Rust-based admission controller integration.
- Wasm runtime (Wasmtime) integration to execute external plugins.
- Secure plugin isolated execution environment.

Nodes need to report health, but privacy is key. Implement a proxy that scrubs sensitive metadata (IPs, cluster names) from telemetry before sending it to public dashboards or monitoring servers.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Integration with OpenTelemetry Collector for scrubbing.
- Differential privacy implementation for reported counts.
- End-to-end encryption for telemetry data.

When CVEs are found in standard images, the operator should automatically trigger a rolling update to the patched version, but only after passing automated smoke tests on a canary node.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Integration with image registry scanners (Trivy/Grype).
- Automated version increment and rollout logic.
- Rollback logic if the patched version impacts consensus health.
