  "Implement Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry (OTel)" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,observability" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Logging and metrics only show part of the story. We need distributed tracing across the operator, the REST API, and the admission webhook to understand reconcile latency and request flow.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Add \`tracing-opentelemetry\` and \`opentelemetry-otlp\` dependencies.
- Configure an OTLP exporter to send traces to a collector (e.g., Jaeger or Tempo).
- Instrument the reconciler and the Axum API server.
- Ensure trace context is propagated through Kubernetes events and webhook requests.
- Provide a Grafana dashboard example that shows tracing spans.

  "Custom Kubernetes Scheduler Plugin for Quorum Proximity" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,performance" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Standard Kubernetes scheduling doesn't understand SCP quorum sets. We want to ensure nodes in the same quorum set are placed appropriately (e.g., in different failure domains but with low latency).

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a [Kubernetes Scheduler Plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/) (using the Go SDK or a Rust equivalent like \`kube-scheduler-rs\`).
- The plugin should read the \`StellarNode\` quorum config and influence the \`Filter\` and \`Score\` phases.
- Prioritize nodes that provide the best latency/redundancy balance for a specific quorum set.
- Provide documentation on how to configure K8s to use this custom scheduler.

  "stellar-wave,enhancement,security" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

To match the philosophy of Soroban, we should allow users to write custom validation policies for \`StellarNode\` resources in WebAssembly.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Integrate a Wasm runtime (like \`wasmtime\` or \`wasmer\`) into the Mutating/Validating webhook.
- Allow the operator to load user-defined \`.wasm\` policies from a ConfigMap.
- Policies should be able to reject or mutate resources based on custom logic (e.g., enforcing specific image registries or resource limits).
- Provide a simple Rust/Wasm policy example.

  "Multi-Region Artifact Sync via OCI-based Snapshots" \
  "stellar-wave,enhancement,performance" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Sharing ledger snapshots across regions using standard PVCs is difficult. We want to leverage OCI registries (like Docker Hub, GHCR) to store and sync ledger snapshots.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a module that can package a ledger snapshot into an OCI image layer.
- Update the operator to push these snapshots to a registry and pull them to bootstrap new nodes in different clusters/regions.
- Automate this process via a Job triggered by the operator.
- Ensure credentials for the registry are handled via K8s Secrets.

  "Advanced SCP Quorum Analysis & Reliability Dashboard" \
  "stellar-wave,observability,reliability" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

A validator is only as strong as its quorum. We need a dashboard that visualizes the entire network's quorum health from the operator's perspective.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Build a custom dashboard (or a Prometheus exporter) that calculates:
  - \"Critical Nodes\": Nodes whose failure would break the quorum.
  - Quorum Set Overlaps.
  - Real-time SCP consensus latency per node.
- Use the data to update the \`StellarNodeStatus\` with a \`QuorumFragility\` score.

  "stellar-wave,enhancement,security" \
  "### 🔴 Difficulty: High (200 Points)

Security is paramount for financial infrastructure. We want the operator to automatically update node images when a critical CVE is detected in the current version.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Integrate with a vulnerability scanner API (e.g., Trivy or Snyk).
- The operator should periodically check the current image version for vulnerabilities.
- If a \"Critical\" CVE is found and a patch version is available, the operator should automatically update the \`StellarNode\` spec and trigger a rollout.
- Include a safety gate (e.g., an annotation to opt-in/out).

Move beyond basic K8s networking and integrate with a Service Mesh for advanced traffic control and mTLS.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Provide \`PeerAuthentication\` and \`DestinationRule\` manifests for Istio.
- Ensure the operator is compatible with sidecar injection.
- Implement circuit breaking and retries for cross-node communication via the mesh config.
- Verify through E2E tests that all traffic is encrypted and authenticated via the mesh.

We need to ensure that no PR degrades the performance of the Stellar nodes or the operator itself.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a GitHub Action or a separate controller that spins up a \`kind\` cluster on every PR.
- Run a standardized load test using \`k6\` and compare the results (TPS/Latency) with a baseline in the \`main\` branch.
- Fail the CI if the performance drops below a certain threshold.
- Post a summary comment on the PR with a performance comparison table.

Help operators understand the cost of their infrastructure.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a controller that integrates with cloud pricing APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Annotate \`StellarNode\` resources with their estimated monthly cost based on spec requirements (CPU/RAM/Storage).
